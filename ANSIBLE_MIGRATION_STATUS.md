  - Installs Scoop-only packages (fzf, psfzf, spotify-player)
  - Error handling with warnings for failed packages
  
- [x] **windows_features** - Windows optional features
  - Enables Hyper-V, Windows Sandbox, WSL2
  - Hardware virtualization detection
  - Reboot detection and management
  
- [x] **powershell_config** - PowerShell configuration deployment
  - Deploys profile files to correct Windows locations
  - Backup support for existing configurations
  
- [x] **obs_config** - OBS Studio configuration deployment

  - Supports both files and directories
  
- [x] **firefox_config** - Firefox configuration deployment
  - Deploys to Firefox profile directories
  - Auto-detects existing profiles

### Documentation
- [x] Comprehensive README for Ansible setup
- [x] Winget to Chocolatey/Scoop package mapping file
- [x] Migration status tracking (this file)

## üîÑ Next Steps

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test Chocolatey package names in mapping file
- [ ] Verify all packages exist in Chocolatey repository
- [ ] Test Scoop package installation (fzf, psfzf, spotify-player)
- [ ] Test playbook on clean Windows machine
- [ ] Validate configuration file deployment paths

### Package Verification Needed
The following packages need verification in Chocolatey:
- [ ] `elgato-wavelink` (might be different name)
- [ ] `elgato-camera-hub` (might be different name)
- [ ] `elgato-streamdeck` (verify exact name)
- [ ] `nilesoft-shell` (verify exact name)
- [ ] `battle.net` vs `battlenet` (check correct name)
- [ ] `goggalaxy` vs `gog-galaxy` (check correct name)

### Configuration Improvements
- [ ] Consider adding package version pinning
- [ ] Add more granular error handling
- [ ] Add configuration validation tasks
- [ ] Add pre-flight checks for target machine readiness

### Security & Production Readiness
- [ ] Set up ansible-vault for password management
- [ ] Add certificate-based WinRM authentication option
- [ ] Add inventory examples for different scenarios

## üóëÔ∏è Ready for Cleanup

Once testing is complete and the Ansible setup is validated:
- [ ] Delete `setup.ps1`
- [ ] Delete `deploy-files.ps1`
- [ ] Delete `installers/` directory
- [ ] Delete `modules/` directory
- [ ] Update main README.md to point to Ansible setup

## üìã Migration Criteria Met

‚úÖ **Ansible modules for everything** - All tasks use native Ansible modules:
- `chocolatey.chocolatey.win_chocolatey` for software installation
- `ansible.windows.win_optional_feature` for Windows features
- `win_copy`, `win_file`, `win_find` for configuration deployment
- `win_shell` only for Windows-specific operations that require it

‚úÖ **Chocolatey for ALL software** - Primary package manager with Scoop for CLI tools:
- Chocolatey: 20+ packages for main Windows software
- Scoop: 3 packages only available in Scoop (fzf, psfzf, spotify-player)

‚úÖ **Custom Ansible roles for configuration** - Dedicated roles for:
- PowerShell profile deployment
- OBS configuration deployment  
- Firefox configuration deployment

‚úÖ **Inventory for separate controller** - Configured for WinRM connections from separate Ansible controller

‚úÖ **Consolidated configuration** - All settings in `group_vars/all.yml`

‚úÖ **Continue with warnings** - Failed package installations generate warnings but don't stop execution

## üöÄ Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
cd ansible
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
# Edit inventory/hosts.yml with your Windows machine details
ansible-vault create group_vars/vault.yml  # Add your Windows password
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/site.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

### Selective Installation
```bash
# All software (Chocolatey + Scoop)
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/site.yml --tags "software" --ask-vault-pass

# Chocolatey packages only
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/site.yml --tags "chocolatey" --ask-vault-pass

# Scoop packages only  
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/site.yml --tags "scoop" --ask-vault-pass

# Configuration only
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/site.yml --tags "config" --ask-vault-pass
```
